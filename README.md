## Overview
To quote [Space.com](https://www.space.com/31802-star-trek-space-tech.html), since viewers first heard the tagline, "... to boldly go where no man has gone before", "Star Trek has represented hope of what space -- 'the final frontier' -- can mean for humanity in a few centuries. 

Star Trek has significantly influenced society, science, technology and succeeding science fiction movies, books, television shows and has spawned online and offline communities of fans and followers.

[Supercluster](https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/star-treks-most-significant-legacy-is-inclusiveness) wrote, one of "Star Trek's most significant legacy: diversity". It added that, "from science to technology to our quest to live among the stars, Star Trek has influenced the way we think, the way we live our lives, and even the devices we use on a daily basis. But there’s one area where Star Trek’s influence is often overlooked: that of representation." It's creator, Gene Rodenberry, said: "The whole show was an attempt to say that humanity will reach maturity and wisdom on the day that it begins not just to tolerate, but to take a special delight in differences in ideas and differences in life forms."

Overall, Star Trek has been influential enough that [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) even wrote an article about it! Titled, ["The Science of Star Trek"](https://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/star_trek.html), the article asked, "Is Star Trek really a science show, or just a lot of 'gee, whiz' nonsensical sci-fi? 

Star Trek is interesting and entertaining. This application, the Trekkies Games also aims to provide some entertainment and enjoyment for the user.

### Design
* Colour Scheme
- The main colours used on the site represent the colours of Star Trek: Black, yellow, blue and red. Additionally, colour green was used to indicate correct answers.
* Typography
- Orbitron font is used for the application logo as this is the closest to Star Trek "look" that's available from Google fonts. It is also used for the introduction message for each of the game page.
Orbitron is paired with Exo 2 font for the game content and for the buttons.
* Imagery
- The three images used for the application all represented the "look" of space, planets and nebulas. The home page image was superimposed by a png image of Star Trek Voyager spaceship from pngegg.
